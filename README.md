# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

## How to Play:
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
You are X (Player 1), your opponent is O (Player 2) or vice versa. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares by clicking on them.
The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
When all 9 squares are full, the game is drawn and over.
Enjoy!
